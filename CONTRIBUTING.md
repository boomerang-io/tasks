# Contributing Guidelines

The Helm project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Issue Types

There are 3 types of issues that we have added to the issue templates;

| Type                  | Purpose                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bug Report            | Create a report to help us improve if something isn't working as expected. |
| Change or Enhancement | A change or improvement suggestion.                                        |
| Support or Inquiry    | When help is needed or to track questions.                                 |

## How to Contribute

Like any good development project, we use Pull Requests (PRs) to track code changes. We recommend that if you want to contrubute and implement a fix, change, or enhancement, you do so by linking the PR with an Issue.

Depending on the access there are two ways to contribute

1. Access to the repository with write ability to create a branch. A PR will be required to merge this branch.

2. Fork the repository and create a PR to be able to link this to the parent repository and request a merge.

## Commit Messages

The commit message should state the change in 72 characters or less. Additionally we recommend, and require in some repositories, the usage of a commit lint and conventional commit so that we can map these to Release Notes.
